        <p><strong>Biased</strong>: the text expresses someone's opinion or editorializes the subject; it uses words or phrasing that express the writer's opinion</p>
        <p><strong>Non-biased</strong>: the text does not express opinion; it is written in a manner that does not express an opinion on the subject</p>
        <p>Biased text might be written in a way that presents an opinion on the subject, while non-bias text describes facts without providing any opinion on them.</p>

      <crowd-text-area> => A field for text input.
      Attributes:
          [auto-focus] A Boolean switch that, if present, puts the cursor in this element on-load so that users can immediately begin typing without having to click inside the element.
          [auto-validate] A Boolean switch that, if present, turns on input validation. The behavior of the validator
        can be modified by the error-message and
        allowed-pattern attributes.
          [char-counter] A Boolean switch that, if present, puts a small text field beneath the lower-right corner of the element, displaying the number of characters inside the element.
          [disabled] A Boolean switch that, if present, displays the input area as disabled.
          [error-message] The text to be displayed below the input field, on the left side, if validation
        fails.
          [label] A string that is displayed inside a text field.This text shrinks and rises up above a text field when the worker starts typing in the
        field or when the value attribute is set.
          [max-length] An integer that specifies the maximum number of characters allowed by the element. Characters typed or pasted beyond the maximum are ignored.
          [max-rows] An integer that specifies the maximum number of rows of text that are allowed within a
        crowd-text-area. Normally the element expands to accommodate new rows. If this is set, after
        the number of rows exceeds it, content scrolls upward out of view and a scrollbar control
        appears.
          [name] A string used to represent the element's data in the output.
          [placeholder] A string presented to the user as placeholder text. It disappears after the user puts
        something in the input area.
          [rows] An integer that specifies the height of the element in rows of text.
          [value] A preset that becomes the default if the worker does not provide input. The preset appears
        in a text field.
